============= What is this? =============
The goal was to replace the autopanel that controls
the generator on their APS-systems. 

The autopanel was replaced by a WAGO PLC programmed in
e!Cockpit. e!Cockpit is very similar to Codesys. 

The was also created a little something in Python
for weatherforecasting.
